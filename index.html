    <div class="Who_we_are_sec">
      <h2 id="Who_we_are">Who We Are</h2>
      <p>We are the software subteam of <a href=
      "https://www.spartatroniks.com/">FRC Team 3512</a> located in Orcutt,
      California. We teach high school students practical software and controls
      engineering skills through <a href=
      "https://www.firstinspires.org/">competitive robotics</a>.</p>
      <p>This website is a collection of student and mentor knowledge and a
      teaching aid.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="Our_vision_sec">
      <h2 id="Our_vision">Our vision</h2>
      <p>Produce competent software engineers who:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Understand the tradeoff between maintainability and performance.</li>
        <li>Can recognize when a given programming language or feature is the
        right fit for a problem.</li>
      </ol>
    </div>
    <div class="What_students_will_learn_sec">
      <h2 id="What_students_will_learn">What students will learn</h2>
    <p>The software subteam programs the robot to make it move and automate
    parts of its functionality. Our goal is to expose you to the software
    engineering process in a low-risk, collaborative learning environment so
    that if you eventually move on to computer science in college or in
    industry, you'll have all the tools you need to succeed.</p>
    <p>You will learn the following throughout your tenure as a software
    subteam member:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The mindset software engineers use to break down and solve problems
      (how to think like a programmer).
        <ul>
          <li>What tools programming languages offer, and when/how to apply
          them solve problems in a manner that is effective, efficient, and
          promotes the long-term maintainability of the software project.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The tools and methodologies software engineers use to collaborate
      with each other and manage the complexity of a software project.</li>
      <li>Software engineering principles for real-time and embedded
      systems.</li>
      <li>Control theory, which lets us do two things:
        <ul>
          <li>Model our robots mathematically so we can test our software's
          correctness before the hardware is completed.</li>
          <li>Design and test controllers for those models that ensure actions
          like "move the elevator to this position" will work with minimal
          trial-and-error on the real hardware.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>How to write automated tests that ensure our software continues to
      work as we add features and perform cleanups.</li>
    </ol>
