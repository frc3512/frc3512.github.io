    <h1>State machines<br>
    <small>State machine lab</small></h1>
    <p>In this lab, we are going to design and implement a simple state
    machine.</p>
    <h2 id="Understanding_the_problem">Understanding the problem</h2>
    <p>The robot for which we are designing this state machine has an elevator
    which is controlled by a pulley connected to a DC brushed motor. A digital
    encoder is used in a feedback controller to control the height of the
    elevator carriage. On the carriage, there are two tines which can be moved
    in and out with a solenoid. This elevator assembly is used for lifting and
    transporting rectangular storage totes.</p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <td><img src="carriage-front.jpg" alt="Carriage Front" width="282"
        height="500"></td>
        <td><img src="carriage-rear.jpg" alt="Carriage Rear" width="282"
        height="500"></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>Your goal is to implement a state machine that automates the tote
    stacking procedure, which is initiated by the robot's user pressing a
    button. They should be able to repeatedly press the button to stack totes
    on the ground denoted by a height of zero inches.</p>
    <h2 id="Setup">Setup</h2>
    <p>Since the purpose of this exercise is practice with state machines, the
    feedback controller and robot subsystem software is provided for you. Copy
    the following files into a new project.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="Main.cpp">Main.cpp</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="RobotMock.cpp">RobotMock.cpp</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="RobotMock.hpp">RobotMock.hpp</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="Timer.cpp">Timer.cpp</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="Timer.hpp">Timer.hpp</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>See the C++ header files (.hpp extension) for a list of available
    functions. <code>RobotMock</code> and <code>Timer</code> are
    <i>classes</i>. They are used in C++ for object-oriented programming and
    defining one's own data types in addition to the built-in ones. They
    contain a list of variables and member functions which are associated with
    an object of that type. If there existed an instance of Timer called and
    its <code>Start()</code> member function were called, that could be done
    with:</p>
    <pre>Timer autonTimer;
autonTimer.Start();</pre>
    <p>The template in <code>Main.cpp</code> includes an <i>enum class</i>.
    Read about their syntax and usage <a href=
    "https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/enum">here</a>. Examples are
    provided <a href=
    "https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/enum#Example">here</a>. The
    underlying type of the enumeration need not be specified and defaults to
    <code>int</code>.</p>
    <h2 id="Designing_the_state_machine">Designing the state machine</h2>
    <p>Since the claw uses a solenoid, the current hardware location cannot be
    known at all times. When the claw actuates in or out, a timer should be
    used in the state machine to wait for the claw to finish moving.</p>
    <p>Feedback controllers like the one controlling the elevator height are
    considered "finished" once they reach their setpoint, so the implementer
    should poll for the carriage reaching the appropriate height rather than
    using a timer.</p>

    <h2 id="Implementation">Implementation</h2>
    <p>Once you are satisfied with your state machine diagram, translate it
    into C++ and test it. <code>Main.cpp</code> provides a template for you to
    do so. You shouldn't need to modify the RobotMock and Timer classes. We
    recommend adding print statements upon entering and exiting your states so
    the state machine's progress is externally visible.</p>
    <h2 id="Submission">Submission</h2>
    <p>See the <a href="../../#Submission">CI submission instructions</a>.</p>
    <p>Use the project name <code>state-machine</code>. Once you are confident
    your state machine works, let your instructor know and they will review
    your work.</p>
