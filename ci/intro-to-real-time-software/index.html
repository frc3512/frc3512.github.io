    <h2 id="Real-time_in_FRC">Real-time in FRC</h2>
    <p>When writing robot code, one should be mindful about how much work a
    given thread is doing relative to its perceived priority. A robot typically
    has the following tasks running in different processes or threads, which
    will be addressed in order of priority.</p>
    <p>Their effective priority can be maintained by either adjusting their
    real-time priority (if they are set as real-time threads or processes) or
    adding waits to the ends of their loops to reduce the rate at which they
    execute.</p>
    <h3 id="FRC_network_communication_process">FRC network communication
    process</h3>
    <p>This process handles communication between the robot and the driver
    station. If other tasks starve this process for CPU time or network
    bandwidth, robot connectivity during competition will be affected.</p>
    <h3 id="Feedback_control_loops">Feedback control loops</h3>
    <p>These run as threads and are typically executed at between 20Hz and
    200hz (periods of 50ms and 5ms respectively). Given that they are digital
    feedback controllers, they should be run as fast as possible, without
    starving other processes, to limit phase loss in the controller
    implementation (see the <a href="../control-theory/">modern control
    theory</a> module for more).</p>
    <h3 id="User_input">User input</h3>
    <p>This includes joystick axis movements, button presses, and other control
    actions originating from the driver via the driver station. These can run
    at lower sample rates since a human's response time to stimuli is much
    slower than the tasks previously mentioned. That is, responding immediately
    is less important.</p>
    <p>A good sample rate for user input is 20ms. See <a href=
    "../robot-software/#Design_patterns">robot software design patterns</a> for
    examples.</p>
    <h3 id="Telemetry_and_logging">Telemetry and logging</h3>
    <p>Information like graph data, print statements, and event logging are the
    least important from a real-time perspective. Their impact should be
    minimized in this regard, but they definitely help for feedback controller
    tuning, assessing robot performance, and debugging.</p>
    <p>Its effect on network bandwidth utilization should also be
    monitored.</p>
