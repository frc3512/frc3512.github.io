    <h2 id="The_mindset_of_an_egoless_engineer">The mindset of an egoless
    engineer</h2>
    <p>The following maxim summarizes what we hope to teach students on the
    software team (with examples drawn from controls engineering).</p>
    <blockquote>
      Engineer based on requirements, not an ideology.
    </blockquote>
    <p>Engineering is filled with trade-offs. The tools should fit the job, and
    not every problem is a nail waiting to be struck by a hammer. Instead,
    assess the minimum requirements (min specs) for a solution to the task at
    hand and do only enough work to satisfy them; exceeding your specifications
    is a waste of time and money. If you require performance or maintainability
    above the min specs, your min specs were chosen incorrectly by
    definition.</p>
    <p>Controls engineering is pragmatic in a similar respect: <i>solve. the.
    problem</i>. For control of non-linear systems, <a href=
    "https://faculty.washington.edu/devasia/Inversion.html">plant inversion</a>
    is elegant on paper but doesn't work with an inaccurate model, yet using a
    theoretically incorrect solution like linear approximations of the
    non-linear system works well enough to be used industry-wide. There are
    more sophisticated controllers than PID, but we use PID anyway for its
    versatility and simplicity. Sometimes the inferior solutions are more
    effective or have a more desirable cost-benefit ratio than what the control
    system designer considers ideal or clean. Choose the tool that is most
    effective.</p>
    <p>Solutions need to be good enough, but do not need to be perfect. We want
    to avoid integrators as they introduce instability, but we use them anyway
    because they work well for meeting tracking specifications. One should not
    blindly defend a design or follow an ideology, because there is always a
    case where its antithesis is a better option. The engineer should be able
    to determine when this is the case, set aside their ego, and do what will
    meet the specifications of their client (e.g., system response
    characteristics, maintainability, usability). Preferring one solution over
    another for pragmatic or technical reasons is fine, but the engineer should
    not care on a personal level which sufficient solution is chosen.</p>
    <p>This is egoless engineering.</p>
    <h2 id="Advice_for_FRC_software_teams">Advice for FRC software teams</h2>
    <h3 id="Engineering_is_about_meeting_requirements">Engineering is about
    meeting requirements</h3>
    <p>If you can meet your requirements with a simpler, less comprehensive
    design, do it. Keep in mind that your requirements can and should include
    cleanliness, readability, and reusability.</p>
    <h3 id="Make_your_code_as_simple_as_possible">Make your code as simple as
    possible</h3>
    <p>Make your code as simple as possible while still meeting your
    functionality and cleanliness requirements. You'll thank yourself later
    when you have to debug it or reuse it.</p>
    <p>A lot can be accomplished with no feedback control and a few lines of
    WPILib. In FRC team 3512's rookie year, their 2011 robot had 100 lines of
    C++ with fully manual control except for a limit switch for automatically
    deploying the minibot. It seeded 7th out of 63 teams. Only start writing
    big, fancy abstractions when it helps attain something that couldn't be
    done easily otherwise.</p>
    <h3 id="Know_the_standard_library_and_WPILib">Know the standard library and
    WPILib</h3>
    <p>There are a lot of difficult problems in robotics and computer science,
    but most of the ones relevant to FRC were already solved by experts in
    those fields. That expertise is made available in libraries such as the
    <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp">C++ standard library</a> and
    <a href="https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/">WPILib</a>. Learn their APIs
    well and use them. There's no use in reinventing the wheel (poorly).</p>
    <h2 id="Curriculum">Curriculum</h2>
    <p>This page serves as a repository of knowledge for topics the software
    team has explored in the past and topics alumni are learning in college.
    Students probably won't be able to learn everything in one year, but
    students are encouraged to learn outside of build sessions to become
    effective members as soon as possible.</p>
    <p>The material here is not a complete guide. It is intended to complement
    lectures and discussion.</p>
    <p>Don't forget that the internet is a valuable resource for software
    development and engineering. This includes <a href=
    "https://www.google.com/">Google</a>, <a href=
    "https://scholar.google.com/">Google Scholar</a>, Stack Overflow, and
    Wikipedia. The latter two are most easily utilized through an indexing
    search engine like Google.</p>

    <h2 id="Instruction_notes">Instruction notes</h2>
    <p>The C++ teaching material has weekly assignments the students are
    expected to work on outside of build sessions and submit via Git. Mentors
    review their submissions and provide feedback during code review. The
    student is only done when review is complete and all issues are addressed.
    While exercises are nominally weekly, they often stretch into three weeks
    because students don't do them.</p>
    <p>The most common issue during review is formatting mistakes. Students can
    use wpiformat to fix almost all complaints in this area.</p>
    <h2 id="Submission">Submission</h2>
    <p>Assignment submissions will be made via Git. To start, make an account
    on <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> if you don't already have one.
    See <a href="intro-to-git/#10_most_commonly_used_Git_commands">this cheat
    sheet</a> for an overview of the most commonly used Git commands. Make
    commits to your repository as often as you feel is necessary.</p>
    <p>The following is an example of the desired Git repository structure and
    naming scheme for the Intro to C++ module. Your source files may have
    different names from those shown or not exist. This may look confusing so
    feel free to ask for help!</p>
      <li>Folders use lowercase only and files use camel case (first letter of
      each word capitalized and the rest lowercase)</li>
      <li>Source code goes in the <code>src</code> directory while other files
      like licenses, makefiles, READMEs and data go outside of it</li>
      <li>For labs, submit all files used according to this format unless
      otherwise stated in the lab.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>It's convention to define <code>main()</code> in a file called
    <code>Main.cpp</code>, but it isn't required and may not make sense for
    projects with only one file.</p>
    <p>Submissions will have our formatter run on them. After setting it up
    according to <a href="../bootstrap/#Formatter">these instructions</a>,
    place <a href="robot-software/generic/.clang-format">.clang-format</a>,
    <a href="robot-software/generic/.styleguide">.styleguide</a>, and <a href=
    "robot-software/generic/.styleguide-license">.styleguide-license</a> in the
    root directory of your repository. You may modify
    <code>.styleguide-license</code> to use your name.</p>
