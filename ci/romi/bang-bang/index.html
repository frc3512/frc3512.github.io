    <h1>Romi Project #1: Bang Bang</h1>
    <h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>A Bang-bang controller is defined as controlling a plant with two
    states: on and off. This on state is applied when we went are system to
    perform an action, while off serves as the "idle" state. In our specific
    example, the drivetrain of the Romi would continue to drive until its
    distance equals or is higher than the desired distance. If you are
    interested in learning more, this <a href=
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bang%E2%80%93bang_control">Wikipedia</a>
    article is a great starting point.</p>
    <h2 id="Goal">Project Goal</h2>
    <p>Your goal is simply to have the Romi drivetrain move forward and then
    stop after a certain distance.</p>
    <h2 id="Recommendation">Recommendation</h2>
    <p>While there are many different solutions to achieve the goal, one
    recoomendation could be:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Make a drive function that takes in a distance (in meters)</li>
      <li>Apply voltage to the Romi motors constantly</li>
      <li>Have logic to set the voltage to 0 once that distance is met</li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
      <i>Note:</i> For this project, it does not matter if you run your code in
      either the telop or autonomous period. However, its recommended to place
      your code into autonomous to practice creating autons.
    </blockquote>
    <h2 id="Tutorial">Project Setup</h2>
    <p>Type CTRL+SHIFT+P in Visual Studio Code, and type "Create a new project"
    (Should have WPILib tagged in front of it). The wizard should appear. For
    the project type, select "Template", "cpp", and then "Romi - Timed Robot".
    Next, selected where to store your project. Team number doesn't matter, but
    you may type your team number if you want to. Make sure to select "Desktop
    Support". Once done, click "Create".</p>
    <blockquote>
      <i>Note:</i> The project needs to have an empty folder to be created. If
      you intend to place your robot project into a Git repo, create it
      somewhere else, and then copy it into it.
