    <h1>Romi Project #2: PID Controller</h1>
    <h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>A PID controller is a feedback controller (), in which you are able to
    set a reference (or a goal), and be able to reach that goal while the 3
    terms are able to correct for slight lapses (or errors) during the journey
    to reach that goal. If you are interested in learning more, this <a href=
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller">Wikipedia</a> article is a
    great starting point.</p>
    <h2 id="Goal">Project Goal</h2>
    <p>Your goal is simply to have the Romi drivetrain move forward and then
    stop after a certain distance.</p>
    <h2 id="Tutorial">Project Setup</h2>
    <p>Type CTRL+SHIFT+P in Visual Studio Code, and type "Create a new project"
    (Should have WPILib tagged in front of it). The wizard should appear. For
    the project type, select "Template", "cpp", and then "Romi - Timed Robot".
    Next, selected where to store your project. Team number doesn't matter, but
    you may type your team number if you want to. Make sure to select "Desktop
    Support". Once done, click "Create".</p>
    <blockquote>
      <i>Note:</i> The project needs to have an empty folder to be created. If
      you intend to place your robot project into a Git repo, create it
      somewhere else, and then copy it into it.
