    <h1>Intro to C++</h1>
    <h2 id="Why_teach_C.2B.2B">Why teach C++</h2>
    <p>We want to teach you how a computer's hardware really works. Knowing a
    lower level language like C++ will make you a more capable developer than
    one who only knows Python or Java. The blog post <a href=
    "https://www.evanmiller.org/you-cant-dig-upwards.html">You Can't Dig
    Upwards</a> explains why.</p>
    <h2 id="Bootstrap">Bootstrap</h2>
    <p>Before you begin, install the tools listed <a href=
    "../../bootstrap/">here</a>, including Git.</p>
    <p>Once the development environment is set up, one may begin learning C++.
    We use the textbook <i>Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++
    (2<sup>nd</sup> edition)</i> by Bjarne Stroustrup (ISBN:
    978-0-321-99278-9), and we provide a free electronic copy to all team
    members (ask the software mentor for it 😀). If you prefer a physical copy
    instead, one can be bought <a href=
    "https://www.informit.com/store/programming-principles-and-practice-using-c-plus-plus-9780321992789">
    directly from the publisher</a>. The current textbook errata are <a href=
    "https://www.stroustrup.com/PPPslides/PPP2errata.html">here</a>.</p>
    <h2 id="Assignments">Assignments</h2>
    <p>Chapter 2 of the book requires <a href=
    "std_lib_facilities.h">std_lib_facilities.h</a>. Useful resources for the
    C++ standard library include <a href=
    "https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp">https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp</a>.</p>
    <p>In addition to the following exercises, we recommend you do <b>all the
    drills</b> at the end of each chapter, although it is not required. See
    section 0.1.2 in the textbook for the reasoning behind this and section
    0.1.1 for the textbook's general approach. The review questions are good
    for checking comprehension, but they aren't exhaustive, so still read
    carefully.</p>
    <p>We recommend covering at least one chapter per week. There may not be
    enough time to lecture on all the material in depth in a given week, so
    individual reading is encouraged. The book is designed for this
    situation.</p>
    <p>Provide answers to any essay questions in a README file. Don't forget to
    read the postscript at the end of each chapter. They provide useful
    insights.</p>

    Technicalities: Classes, etc.</h3>
    <p>Just read the chapter.</p>
    <h3 id="Advanced">Advanced</h3>
    <p>Students wanting to cover more advanced topics of the C++ programming
    language should read chapters 17-21 from Part III in order. They cover data
    structures, algorithms, memory management, and templates.</p>
    <h2 id="Submission">Submission</h2>
    <p>See the <a href="https://frc3512.github.io/ci/#Submission">CI submission
    instructions</a>.</p>
    <p>For files which are modified between assigned problems, there should
    still be a separate project for each problem. For example, chapter 4's
    exercises 19 through 21 will have a separate project each for
    <code>exercise19</code>, <code>exercise20</code>, and
    <code>exercise21</code>. Copy-pasting the previous project's files may make
    this easier.</p>
