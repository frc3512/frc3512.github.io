    <h1>Computer vision</h1><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> <a href=
    "../intro-to-cpp/">Intro to C++</a>
    <h2 id="Labs">Labs</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Coming soon...</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>Read the articles on computer vision on <a href=
    "https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/vision-processing/index.html">
    docs.wpilib.org</a>. Since we'll be using OpenCV in C++, pay attention to
    the C++ code examples on those pages.</p>
    <h2 id="Vision_applications">Vision applications</h2>
    <p>For an example of using vision for motion control, watch <a href=
    "https://www.team254.com/documents/vision-control/">this video</a> by FRC
    team 254. It gives advice on building a robust vision pipeline and how to
    combine it with other feedback controllers on the robot while compensating
    for camera and processing latency.</p>
    <h2 id="GRIP_computer_vision_engine">GRIP computer vision engine</h2>
    <p>You should now have an understanding of the basic principles involved in
    computer vision. However, it takes practice to gain an intuition for what
    pipeline operations to apply to find the desired features in an image. GRIP
    can help here by providing a drag-and-drop interface that shows the output
    of intermediate processing steps. It can be downloaded from <a href=
    "https://wpiroboticsprojects.github.io/GRIP/">here</a>.</p>
    <h2 id="Object_detection_with_deep_learning">Object detection with deep
    learning</h2>Read the resources provided <a href=
    "https://github.com/floodsung/Deep-Learning-Papers-Reading-Roadmap#32-object-detection">
    here</a>.
