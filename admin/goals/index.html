    <h1>Goals</h1>
    <p>The following is a list of goals the software team tries to meet each
    year. They inform decisions regarding our curriculum design and operating
    procedures.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Produce an effective product</li>
      <li>Employ industry best practices</li>
      <li>Expand our knowledge and capabilities</li>
      <li>Involve less experienced team members</li>

          <li>Find tasks requiring less experience</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Create an autonomous software team / encourage learning</li>
      <li style="list-style: none; display: inline">
        <ul>
          <li>Provide access to resources for motivated students</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="Curriculum_design_guidelines">Curriculum design guidelines</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <b>Teach incoming members enough C++ to be useful</b>
        <p>Integrate modern C++ development paradigms, tools, and practices.
        The C++ language has improved a lot since 2003; we don't need to
        program in the dark ages anymore.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Teach a set of skills motivated by industry best practices</b>
        <p>By industry best practices, we don't mean extremely conservative,
        waterfall model practices. We're more focused on breaking down and
        solving problems using industry standard tools. We emphasize
        reliability, but reliability and innovation aren't mutually
        exclusive.</p>
        <p>Software shall meet embedded and <a href=
        "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing">real-time</a>
        requirements.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Prepare students for Computer Science at university</b>
        <p>The focus should be on "Design before build". That is, developing a
        specification for behavior before implementing it. Teach common
        development practices like Git and code review.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Teach an introduction to control theory for those interested</b>
        <p>This is also needed for a reliable / maximally efficient robot and
        includes state machines, motion profiles, filters, and
        feedback/feedforward controllers.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2 id="Lab_design_guidelines">Lab design guidelines</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <b>Provide implementations for things unrelated to the lab's learning
        outcomes</b>
        <p>The student shouldn't get bogged down in setting up infrastructure
        for their solution if the lab is intended to teach something specific.
        For example, the state machine lab <a href=
        "../../ci/state-machines/state-machine/">here</a> provides a template
        with all the subsystems necessary to implement a robot's state machine.
        The comments tell the student where to insert their state machine
        logic, as practicing writing state machine logic is the purpose of the
        lab.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Assuming a few prerequisites is acceptable to enable showcasing a
        topic's utility</b>
        <p>By showcasing advanced topics in an approachable, introductory way,
        students can appreciate the breadth of knowledge they can and will
        learn. If prerequisites are skipped, the lab should provide requisite
        knowledge as it is needed to understand or implement dependent
        concepts.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Labs should encourage students to develop practical methods for
        solving problems</b>
        <p>Labs exist to provide hands-on experience with a topic. They should
        supplement the theoretical material covered in lecture to foster
        practical or intuitive understanding. After finishing a module and its
        labs, students should be capable of applying topics initially
        introduced in lecture.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Use graphical tools to gain insight</b>
        <p>Basically, a picture or movie is worth a thousand words. The
        following are good examples of visualization tools.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href="https://github.com/frc3512/LiveGrapher">LiveGrapher</a>
            allows visualizing physical phenomena in real time.
          </li>
          <li><i>rltool</i> from MATLAB aids in students' intuitive
          understanding of how root locus plots represent a system's response
          and how the pole and zero locations affect the plot.</li>
          <li>GRIP facilitates experimentation with complex image processing
          operations via an easy-to-use package.</li>
        </ul><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Common wisdom imparted through lectures should be motivated in labs
        with data</b>
        <p>For example, it is understood that mutexes are preferred over
        lock-free data structures unless there are scalability requirements for
        distributed, concurrent accesses. A lab requiring the implementation of
        an atomic data structure may motivate the exercise by making a mutex
        implementation first, then benchmarking both. (This would be a good
        opportunity to show the utility of and best practices for benchmarking
        software, by the way.)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Use industry standard tools to handle auxiliary tasks</b>
        <p>Students should be able to leverage existing tools to make their
        jobs as software developers easier. Labs are encouraged to use tooling
        if it doesn't automate what the student is intended to learn through
        practice.</p>
        <p>In the previous example, Clang's thread sanitizer tool may be used
        to verify correctness of the data structures' synchronization.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2 id="Learning_outcomes">Learning outcomes</h2>
    <p>This is a list of topics we hope to teach software team members
    throughout their membership. These may not all be accomplished in one
    season. They are mainly structured in a way for which we can test
    competence.</p>
    <p>They include programming-specific topics such as C++, program planning
    and implementation, testing and debugging, version control, and
    robot-specific topics including control theory. Inter-team communication is
    important for most of these.</p>

    <p>Us mentors assume you already know how to write software. Software
    engineering is what we really want to teach you. If you can explain this
    year's robot code and why you designed it <i>that</i> way versus the other
    possible designs, you have succeeded and have likely earned a <a href=
    "../varsity/">varsity letter</a>. It shows you contributed in the design
    phase and know the trade-offs (engineering is essentially the process of
    choosing the least bad design based on some criteria and justifying that
    choice). Our role as mentors is to show you what tools are available in the
    C++ language so you can make an informed design decision.</p>
