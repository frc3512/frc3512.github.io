      <i>This is an email Tyler sent in response to a verbal request for
      feedback on formal varsity letter requirements. It is being preserved
      here for posterity.</i>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Hi Grace,</p>
    <p>Since you mentioned on Tuesday that the team was putting together more
    formal varsity letter requirements, you may be interested in the
    requirements the software team has been using for the last 2+ years. They
    are linked on <a href=
    "https://frc3512.github.io/admin/">https://frc3512.github.io/admin/</a>.
    This email was originally intended just to mention that, but the fact that
    varsity letter requirements are even an issue implies there are more
    systemic issues. The rest of this email elaborates on what I mean and how I
    feel these issues should be addressed.</p>
    <h2 id="Varsity_letter_requirements">Varsity letter requirements</h2>
    <p>I'm hoping the software team's varsity letter requirements can be
    incorporated into the team-wide requirements in some way. Having every
    subteam document what constitutes a varsity letter in terms of specific
    hard and soft skills as the software team has done would not only give new
    students an idea of what to expect as a member of each subteam, but would
    also help leadership develop an appreciation for the work each subteam
    does. This would address frequent complaints of varsity letter
    recommendations being overruled, only to have them reversed when the
    subteam in question challenges it.</p>
    <h2 id="Basic_knowledge">Basic knowledge</h2>
    <p>As an example of what I mean by appreciation of each subteam's work, the
    leadership (at minimum) should be able to understand at a basic level what
    each subteam mentions at opening and closing meetings. At least with
    software, this requirement hasn't been met. When we mention our problems
    and plans for addressing them, one of two things happens: 1) we explain
    things in sufficient detail and everyone just nods, and says "oh, more big
    words from the software people"; 2) we explain things with hopelessly vague
    descriptions because we have to strip out all our descriptive terminology,
    then we get yelled at for being too vague. I find both of these responses
    disrespectful because the majority of the things we mention are basic
    software concepts that all our rookies learn within their first year. I'm
    not saying everyone needs to be an expert on every subteam, but they should
    at least know the basics of what each subteam is capable of and how they
    work. I want to avoid subteams ignoring each other's needs as well as
    subteams attempting to compensate for this with well-meaning gestures but
    useless gestures that are a result of their ignorance. The mechanical team
    generally knows you need a router and CAN wires going from the roboRIO to
    the power distribution panel and that motors require electricity across
    their leads to run. Why can't the same high-level basic understanding be
    afforded to software or business? An analog for this exists in the
    corporate world, by the way: technical managers. They know how to manage a
    team, but aren't clueless about the tasks they hand out to their
    subordinates. This means they know how much work something will
    realistically take, be able to determine if a subordinate is slacking off,
    and be able to plan more effectively for the future.</p>
    <h2 id="What_leadership_should_know_about_the_software_team">What
    leadership should know about the software team</h2>
    <p>On the software team, we've seen that if all our members know what needs
    to be done, the role of a lead becomes redundant because they can
    coordinate tasks amongst themselves. Being able to function without direct
    oversight from a lead and work toward a common vision has made us really
    effective over the years. However, a prerequisite to this is visibility
    into how the subteam works at all. Pursuant to this, I would expect
    non-software leadership to know the following about the software team:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>We have standard operating procedures and our own set of goals. They
      are detailed in <a href=
      "https://frc3512.github.io/admin/goals/">https://frc3512.github.io/admin/goals/</a>.
      </li>
      <li>Software is not magic that makes the robot move. Robots follow simple
      instructions and basic logic, and you can write them yourself in English
      (If this condition is true, then do that thing. Drive for 5 meters, then
      turn right, etc.).</li>
      <li>There are important factors involved in making a mechanism
      controllable by software. See <a href=
      "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNfFn-gcfFI&amp;list=PLk1Mm-3aieXWa0eyDP1_MahuzqhVsDQXd&amp;index=1">
        971's video on it</a>.
      </li>
      <li>Sensors are not magic, and the average electrical student should
      understand what kinds of sensors there are and what kinds of robot motion
      they can measure.</li>
      <li>We use version control. Each robot's code is stored in a
      "repository". We work on features separately in what's called a "branch",
      which are eventually merged into the "master" branch that always contains
      working code. We do this at competition too.</li>
      <li>We do code review for quality assurance. The site we use is
        <a href="https://github.com/frc3512">https://github.com/frc3512</a>,
        which lets us leave comments on code and push fixes to feature branches
        based on that review. We always push what we've worked on to that
        server at the end of each day, so no one programmer is required to be
        at a build session on any given day to continue another's work.
      </li>
      <li>If anyone wants to see the robot code's progress, they can do so by
      viewing the relevant repository at <a href="https://github.com/frc3512">
        https://github.com/frc3512</a>.
      </li>
      <li>All our curriculum is online: <a href=
      "https://frc3512.github.io/ci/">https://frc3512.github.io/ci/</a>.
      Everything the software team learns on a yearly basis is documented there
      somewhere. This is how we've managed to do consistently well with just
      one local mentor and one mentor that's typically hours away. The rest of
      the team should consider documenting what they know somewhere so that
      knowledge isn't lost every time a student graduates.
      </li>
      <li>The software team is not an IT department. When the Driver Station
      stops connecting to the robot, we're just as clueless as you are. We
      usually just press power buttons at random and reboot things until it
      works. In fact, your average "IT expert" is basically just following the
      steps in this webcomic: <a href=
      "https://xkcd.com/627/">https://xkcd.com/627/</a>. As one of these
      supposed "IT experts", I can confirm this is exactly what we do.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Hopefully this long-winded email helps explain some things.</p>
