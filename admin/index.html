            <h2>Student Structure</h2>
            <p>Since 3512 was founded, the software team has enjoyed a certain level of autonomy.
              With that, we've been free to establish our own internal leadership structure.
              Rather than a typical top-down leadership structure, we operate more like a "software committee".
              Everyone is equal and contributes to the code base on their own volition with mentors
              performing quality control. There is a software lead who handles meetings and shields the
              members from administrative stuff, but the title doesn't imply any superiority or power over the
              other members.</p>
            <p>This works best when everyone is equal in skill level, so the mentors work hard to promote
              learning among rookies to raise their level of competency to that of their peers.
              We encourage collaboration with the other students to aid in this process.</p>

            <h2>Role of The Mentor</h2>
            <p>Mentors teach rookies the basics of writing software and enough of the tools to make them productive
              contributors. The veterans already know how to write software, so the mentors can focus on actually
              teaching them software engineering. Ideally, the students contribute during the design process and
              are able to justify their design decisions.</p>
            <p>The students learn the subject matter most efficiently with mentor guidance, so the mentors are
              fundamentally in a partnership with the students. While the students should do the work, the mentors
              should use their experience to inform the students of available tools and potential pitfalls so an
              informed design decision is made. In this sense, the mentors are primarily in an advisory role.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, mentors should always provide an unbiased analysis. Transparency helps build trust,
              and specific solutions always have drawbacks. The mentor should be honest about them so the students
              develop a level-headed view of the world.</p>
            <p>However, the mentors also possess the long-term vision for the team and should push the boundaries of
              the team's accomplishments each year to achieve it. To do this, the mentors may implement tricky
              bits of framework code, but the students should still understand what has been written and should
              be walked through it step-by-step if necessary. Remember that FIRST is a mentor-based program, but 
              t is for the students; giving them a sense of accomplishment and ownership keeps them engaged and 
              eturning each year.</p>

            <h2>Learning vs Reusing</h2>
            <p>I like to take the "add tools to the toolbox" approach with my software team. We try some random
              alternative to improve on previous architecture, and a student or two takes that on as an
              R&D project. They usually stabilize and end up on the robot by the time competition occurs.
              We've done probably four different approaches to state machines at this point, and our controls
              solutions have evolved a lot. Prefer evolution over revolution.</p>
