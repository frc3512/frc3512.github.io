            The following is a list of goals the software team tries to meet each year.
            They inform decisions regarding our curriculum design and operating procedures.
          </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Produce an effective product</li>
              <li>Employ industry best practices</li>
              <li>Expand our knowledge and capabilities</li>
              <li>Involve less experienced team members</li>
              <li>Find tasks requiring less experience</li>
              <li>Create an autonomous software team / encourage learning</li>
              <li>Provide access to resources for motivated students</li>
           </ul>

           <h2>Curriculum Goals</h2>
           <b><p>Teach incoming members enough C++ to be useful</p></b>
              <p>Integrate modern C++ development paradigms, tools, and practices</p>
           <b><p>Teach a set of skills motivated by industry best practices</p></b>
              <p>By industry best practices, we don't mean extremely conservative, waterfall model practices.
                We're more focused on breaking down and solving problems using industry standard tools.
                We emphasize reliability, but reliability and innovation aren't mutually exclusive.</p>
              <p>Software shall meet embedded and real-time requirements</p>
            <b><p>Prepare students for Computer Science at university</p></b>
              <p>The focus should be on "Design before build". That is, developing a specification for behavior
              before implementing it.</p>
              <p>Teach common development practices like Git and code review.</p>
            <b><p>Teach an introduction to control theory for those interested</p></b>
              <p>This is also needed for a reliable / maximally efficient robot and includes state machines,
              motion profiles, filters, and feedback/feedforward controllers.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="Info_Main" id="Lone">
            <h2>Lab design guidelines</h2>
              <b><p>Provide implementations for things unrelated to the lab's learning outcomes</p></b>
                <p>The student shouldn't get bogged down in setting up infrastructure for their solution if the lab
                  is intended to teach something specific. For example, the state machine lab here provides a template
                  with all the subsystems necessary to implement a robot's state machine. The comments tell the student
                  where to insert their state machine logic, as practicing writing state
                  machine logic is the purpose of the lab.</p>
              <b><p>Assuming a few prerequisites is acceptable to enable showcasing a topic's utility</p></b>
                <p>By showcasing advanced topics in an approachable, introductory way, students can appreciate the breadth
                  of knowledge they can and will learn. If prerequisites are skipped, the lab should provide requisite
                  knowledge as it is needed to understand or implement dependent concepts.</p>
              <b><p>Labs should encourage students to develop practical methods for solving problems</p></b>
                  <p>Labs exist to provide hands-on experience with a topic. They should supplement the theoretical
                    material covered in lecture to foster practical or intuitive understanding. After finishing a
                    module and its labs, students should be capable of applying topics initially introduced in
                    lecture.</p>
              <b><p>Use graphical tools to gain insight</p></b>
                  <p>Basically, a picture or movie is worth a thousand words. The following are good examples of
                    visualization tools.</p>
                  <p>rltool from MATLAB aids in students' intuitive understanding of how root locus plots
                    represent a system's response and how the pole and zero locations affect the plot.</p>
                  <p>GRIP facilitates experimentation with complex image processing operations via an
                    easy-to-use package.</p>
              <b><p>Common wisdom imparted through lectures should be motivated in labs with data</p></b>
                  <p>For example, it is understood that mutexes are preferred over lock-free data structures unless
                    there are scalability requirements for distributed, concurrent accesses. A lab requiring the
                    implementation of an atomic data structure may motivate the exercise by making a mutex
                    implementation first, then benchmarking both. (This would be a good opportunity to show the
                    utility of and best practices for benchmarking software, by the way.)</p>
              <b><p>Use industry standard tools to handle auxiliary tasks</p></b>
                  <p>Students should be able to leverage existing tools to make their jobs as
                    software developers easier. Labs are encouraged to use tooling if it doesn't automate
                    what the student is intended to learn through practice.</p>
