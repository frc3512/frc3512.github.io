<!-- Goals
The following is a list of goals the software team tries to meet each year. They inform decisions regarding our curriculum design and operating procedures.

Produce an effective product
Employ industry best practices
Expand our knowledge and capabilities
Involve less experienced team members
Find tasks requiring less experience
Create an autonomous software team / encourage learning
Provide access to resources for motivated students
Teach incoming members enough C++ to be useful
Integrate modern C++ development paradigms, tools, and practices. 

Software shall meet embedded and real-time requirements.

Prepare students for Computer Science at university
The focus should be on "Design before build". That is, developing a specification for behavior before implementing it. Teach common development practices like Git and code review.

Teach an introduction to control theory for those interested
This is also needed for a reliable / maximally efficient robot and includes state machines, motion profiles, filters, and feedback/feedforward controllers.
Use graphical tools to gain insight
Basically, a picture or movie is worth a thousand words. The following are good examples of visualization tools.

Use industry standard tools to handle auxiliary tasks
Students should be able to leverage existing tools to make their jobs as software developers easier. Labs are encouraged to use tooling if it doesn't automate what the student is intended to learn through practice.
Lab design guidelines
Provide implementations for things unrelated to the lab's learning outcomes
The student shouldn't get bogged down in setting up infrastructure for their solution if the lab is intended to teach something specific. For example, the state machine lab here provides a template with all the subsystems necessary to implement a robot's state machine. The comments tell the student where to insert their state machine logic, as practicing writing state machine logic is the purpose of the lab.

Assuming a few prerequisites is acceptable to enable showcasing a topic's utility
By showcasing advanced topics in an approachable, introductory way, students can appreciate the breadth of knowledge they can and will learn. If prerequisites are skipped, the lab should provide requisite knowledge as it is needed to understand or implement dependent concepts.

Labs should encourage students to develop practical methods for solving problems
Labs exist to provide hands-on experience with a topic. They should supplement the theoretical material covered in lecture to foster practical or intuitive understanding. After finishing a module and its labs, students should be capable of applying topics initially introduced in lecture.
