    <p>The following is a list of goals the software team tries to meet each
    year. They inform decisions regarding our curriculum design and operating
    procedures.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Produce an effective product</li>
      <li>Employ industry best practices</li>
      <li>Expand our knowledge and capabilities</li>
      <li>Involve less experienced team members</li>
      <li style="list-style: none; display: inline">
        <ul>
          <li>Find tasks requiring less experience</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Create an autonomous software team / encourage learning</li>
      <li style="list-style: none; display: inline">
        <ul>
          <li>Provide access to resources for motivated students</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="Curriculum_Design_Guidelines">Curriculum Design Guidelines</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <b>Teach incoming members enough C++ to be useful</b>
        <p>Integrate modern C++ development paradigms, tools, and practices.
        The C++ language has improved a lot since 2003; we don't need to
        program in the dark ages anymore.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Teach a set of skills motivated by industry practices</b>
        <p>These aren't in the extremely conservative, waterfall model sense,
        but in knowing how to break down and solve a problem using industry
        standard tools, which help students succeed in such a job.</p>
        <p>Software shall meet embedded and <a href=
        "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing">real-time</a>
        requirements.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Prepare students for Computer Science at university</b>
        <p>The focus should be on "Design before build". That is, eveloping a
        specification for behavior before implementing it. Teach common
        development practices like Git and code review.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Teach an introduction to control theory for those interested</b>
        <p>This is also needed for a reliable / maximally efficient robot and
        includes state machines, motion profiles, filters, and
        feedback/feedforward controllers.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2 id="Lab_Design_Guidelines">Lab Design Guidelines</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <b>Assuming a few prerequisites is acceptable to enable showcasing a
        topic's utility</b>
        <p>By showcasing advanced topics in an approachable, introductory way,
        students can appreciate the breadth of knowledge they can and will
        learn. If prerequisites are skipped, the lab should provide requisite
        knowledge as it is needed to understand or implement dependent
        concepts.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Labs should encourage students to develop practical methods for
        solving problems</b>
        <p>Labs exist to provide hands-on experience with a topic. They should
        supplement the theoretical material covered in lecture to foster
        practical or intuitive understanding. After finishing a module and its
        labs, students should be capable of applying topics initially
        introduced in lecture.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Use graphical tools to gain insight</b>
        <p>Basically, a picture or movie is worth a thousand words. The
        following are good examples of visualization tools.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href="https://github.com/Team3512/LiveGrapher">LiveGrapher</a>
            allows visualizing physical phenomena in real time.
          </li>
          <li><i>rltool</i> from MATLAB aids in students' intuitive
          understanding of how root locus plots represent a system's response
          and how the pole and zero locations affect the plot.</li>
          <li>GRIP facilitates experimentation with complex image processing
          operations via an easy-to-use package.</li>
        </ul><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Common wisdom imparted through lectures should be motivated in labs
        with data</b>
        <p>For example, it is understood that mutexes are preferred over
        lock-free data structures unless there are scalability requirements for
        distributed, concurrent accesses. A lab requiring the implementation of
        an atomic data structure may motivate the exercise by making a mutex
        implementation first, then benchmarking both. (This would be a good
        opportunity to show the utility of and best practices for benchmarking
        software, by the way.)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Use industry standard tools to handle auxiliary tasks</b>
        <p>Students should be able to leverage existing tools to make their
        jobs as software developers easier. Labs are encouraged to use tooling
        if it doesn't automate what the student is intended to learn through
        practice.</p>
        <p>In the previous example, Clang's thread sanitizer tool may be used
        to verify correctness of the data structures' synchronization.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2 id="Learning_Outcomes">Learning Outcomes</h2>
    <p>This is a list of topics we hope to teach software team members
    throughout their membership. These may not all be accomplished in one
    season. They are mainly structured in a way for which we can test
    competence.</p>
    <p>They include programming-specific topics such as C++, program planning
    and implementation, testing and debugging, version control, and
    robot-specific topics including control theory. Inter-team communication is
    important for most of these.</p>
