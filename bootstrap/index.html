    <p>This page provides setup instructions for the software team's tools so
    members can quickly start learning C++. If anything doesn't make sense or
    you need help, please contact a team member or mentor.</p>
    <p>Please install 64-bit versions of tools if possible and make sure the
    bitness of all your tools matches by using the appropriate
    archives/installers.</p>

    <h3 id="Visual_Studio_Code">Visual Studio Code</h3>
    <p>Visual Studio Code is an integrated development environment which makes
    it easier to write, build, and test programs written in C++, Python, and
    more! Once set up using one of the installation methods above, then all you
    need to know is how to use the terminal and a little bit of git to get
    started.</p>
    <p>Note: Visual Studio Code occasionally shows outdated or false errors in
    a project file. There is no workaround, so instead just use gradle/CMake to
    build your project. Keep in mind errors shown in the IDE aren't
    authoritative. The console build output should be used to determine whether
    the executable was built successfully.</p>
    <h3 id="GCC_compiler">GCC compiler</h3>
    <p>This is the compiler gradle or CMake will use to build the programs you
    write.</p>
    <h3>CMake</h3>
    <p>CMake will be used to build your personal projects. For better
    integration with VS Code, download the "CMake Tools" extension under VS
    Code's extensions tab.</p>
    <h3 id="Gradle">Gradle</h3>
    <p>Gradle is a build automation tool that we use to build the robot
    project. To use it, just run one of the scripts in the robot project. See
    <a href="https://github.com/frc3512/Robot-2020#build-options">here</a> for
    more.</p>
    <h3 id="Git">Git</h3>
    <p>Git is a version control system used to manage the code you write. See
    <a href="../ci/intro-to-git/">Intro to Git</a> for more information and
    detailed setup.</p>
    <h3 id="GitHub">GitHub</h3>
    <p>GitHub provides web based code review and repository management for the
    Git version control system. Our GitHub organization is <a href=
    "https://github.com/frc3512/">here</a>. User setup instructions are
    <a href="../ci/github/#Setup">here</a>.</p>
    <h3 id="Formatter">Formatter</h3>
    <p>Formatters help ensure style guide conformance by automatically
    correcting deviations. We use the Python 3 scripts provided in WPILib's
    style guide repository and clang-format for source code formatting. We also
    use Python 3 for optimizing feedback control system behavior. To run the
    formatter on a project, run:</p><code>python3 -m wpiformat</code>
    <blockquote>
      <i>Note:</i> The formatter should be considered a safety net. It is good
      practice to be familiar with the enforced style guide and be able to
      write code in that style directly.
