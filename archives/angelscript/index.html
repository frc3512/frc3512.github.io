          <h1>ScriptRobot</h1>
          <p>Hello fellow FRC teams. We all know that sometimes reloading code
          onto the robot can be a pain. One has to deploy, restart, and wait
          for the robot and router to boot back up. This can take around 2
          minutes and unforseen runtime errors can occur after one deploys,
          which forces one to deploy and reboot again. This can be a hassle if
          one needs to change something quickly or load a different set of
          instructions for the autonomous period. Reloading code like this on
          the practice field may consume all of the time one has to
          practice.</p>
          <p>Many people have looked for and found an answer in many different
          places, mostly in the form of interpreted languages. People have
          created bindings for WPILib to languages like Lua, Python and
          Gordian. But we've found AngelScript to be the best solution for
          us.</p>
          <h2 id="What_is_AngelScript.3F">What is AngelScript?</h2>
          <p>AngelScript is powerful scripting language created by Andreas
          Jönsson. It's main features include familiar C/C++ syntax with few
          deviations, the ability to create C++ classes and structs in scripts,
          and runtime compilation of scripts into byte code. The library is
          very easy to use as an application writer as well. You simply bind
          functions as they are with no need for proxy functions. This means
          scripts only have access to what the application writer allows. All
          these features make for a very powerful scripting language with
          execution speed comparable to Java.</p>
          <p>AngelScript is hosted at <a href=
          "http://www.angelcode.com/angelscript/">www.angelcode.com/angelscript</a>.</p>
          <h2 id="Benefits_in_FRC">Benefits in FRC</h2>
          <h3 id="Syntax_consistency">Syntax consistency</h3>
          <p>Instead of programming in a weaker typed language for the benefit
          of scripting, one can write in AngelScript, which uses the C++ syntax
          that many programmers are used to with Wind River development while
          also allowing for reloading during runtime. You can make powerful
          classes and structs in the script, and if one needs more
          functionality that isn't available in the basic framework, it can
          easily be implemented without the need for proxy functions.</p>
          <h3 id="Speed">Speed</h3>
          <p>AngelScript is much faster than any other scripting language.
          Every script is compiled to bytecode which instructs the runtime to
          execute the appropriate PowerPC assembly instructions, so its speed
          is comparable to that of Java on the cRIO.</p>
          <h2 id="Distribution">Distribution</h2>
          <p>We are providing a simple, easily usable framework that includes a
          packaging/building class, a script robot class that runs on the robot
          using the contents of a package, and a deployment tool.</p>
          <p>The ScriptRobot project by FRC team 3512's Harrison Miller is
          released under the GPLv3 license.</p>
