<!-- History
2016 - Cressida
2016 game
The objective of the game is to score as many points as possible by shooting in a high goal or pushing into low goals volley ball size balls that had the density of a plush dodgeball. As well, you could score points on going through different obstacles and also climbing. For that year we decided to do everything however our shooter never fully operated. We primarily did the obstacles and climbed consistently. In autonomous, due to us recieving very little time with the robot (2 days) we were able to make it go forward off of a timed loop.

2017 - Antikythera
2017 game
The objective of the game is to score as many points as possible by transporting gears to the airship and shooting fuel (balls) into the boiler. We didn't build a shooter because we haven't built consistent ones yet and the point trade-off wasn't worth it. We decided that the two main ways of obtaining points were to hang the gear via GPU (Gear Picker Upper. Yes, we understand this name is cringey) and to climb a rope via a winch. In autonomous, the main goal was to hang a gear.

2017 unique features

2018 - Diakoptis
2018 game
The objective of the game is to score as many points as possible by tilting a switch and a scale into your favor. The longer you hold the switch and scale the more points you get. The switch is low to the ground and the scale is much higher to reach. As well the end game involves climbing and in our instance, often times with another robot on our back. We decided to do all of the game with a pawl system and a CPU (cube picker upper, these naming conventions are on point). In autonomous the main goal was to be able to score in all of the various positions as well as in all goals.

2018 unique features
A lot of different autonomous modes
Hot-swappable camera streams
Pneumatic code galore
Winch code as well as a low gear code
Limit switches that use Hall effect sensors
Soft limit switches for elevator to prevent topping out
Use of driver station displays UI
Motion profiles
Event driven system with event queue per subsystem
